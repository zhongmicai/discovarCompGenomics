DISCOVAR paper plan outline## Evolutionary dynamics across Heliconius###Introduction 
- Adaptive radiation 	- specifically, the idea of key innovations- advantages of whole genome sequencing	- identify large-scale chromosomal rearrangements	- use as a resource for population-level work- Heliconius, and why they are a good system- DISCOVAR, and why it is a good tool###Materials and Methods- DNA extraction(supplementary – get extraction protocols from all labs involved)- Sequencing and Assembly- DISCOVAR – ask Wiesenfeld or Jaffe? Alternatively site forum?- Possibly TAGC scaffolding- haplomerger- Multiple alignment- progressiveCactus- use Kozak tree to prior topology- Data Analysis###ResultsTable 1: Assembly statistics for all species	- from Davey: N50, length, largest scaffold, BUSCOFigure 1: Example of a DISCOVAR assembly	- Use the figure design from LepbaseFigure S1: All of the DISCOVAR assemblies in Lepbase formatFigure S2: Alignment quality control for H. melpomene DISCO to Hmel2Figure 2: Whole genome treePossible Supplementaries: CDS tree, 4D sites tree, non-coding tree, UCE tree, non-UCE treeFigure 3: Genome structure conservation
- show syntenic breaks- This might be a messy figure with so many genomes/comparisons, so maybe we can just look for major differences and think of a way to display them wellFigure 4: Genome sequence conservation  
- proportion conserved across group- proportion conserved within heliconius- proportion conserved within clades- For statistical interest, compare random subsets- for all groups, look at coding vs non-codingFigure 5: Evolutionary rates/Positive Selection
- dN/dS along all branches	- substitution rate- comparison as aboveFigure 6-X: Candidate loci exploration###Next paper? - fine-scale phylogeny and introgression
- use SOM/HMM models or mosquito paper technique to get trees along genome -	How old are the trees?-	How much of the genome does each tree represent?-	How large are the genomic blocks that represent each tree type?
